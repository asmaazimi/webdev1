            <p><strong>My Mission Statement:</strong><br>
                <br>
                My mission is to provide the consumer 
                with the highest <br>level of service of any Real Estate company 
                thereby <br> ensuring that properties are sold or leased in an exemplary <br>
                manner. I endeavor to deliver professional service <br> to clients and

                <br>
                "I recently had the pleasure of working with Avery when 
                looking <br>for my home. From day 1, Avery was extremely 
                responsive and<br> had great suggestions for homes to view based 
                on what I was<br> looking for. All throughout the negotiations 
                and closing Avery <br>was there quickly handling any 
                issues that may have risen. If<br> the time ever comes when I 
                will be looking for a new home, there <br>isn't any question 
                on who my Realtor will be!" - Melissa 5/5

                "I had the pleasure for working with Avery Shaw. From start 
                to <br>finish she was very responsive, kind, and a constant professional.<br>
                 I look forward to the opportunity to work with her and the 
                 Real<br> Estate Team again." - Brandon 5/5

                 <br>
                 "Avery Shaw's Real Estate Team worked with us 
                 from mid-August <br>identifying the right property to meet our 
                 needs. She was always <br>accessible and willing to make a variety 
                 of suggestions and<br> options as we tried to. Are the right 
                 decision. We feel we have a <br>trustworthy agent, as well as 
                 a friend! Thank you, Avery!" - Lois 5/5
